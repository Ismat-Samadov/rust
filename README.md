# Rust Image Processing Application

This is a command-line image processing application written in Rust. It supports various operations such as blurring, brightening, cropping, rotating, inverting, grayscale conversion, generating solid color images, and creating fractal images.

## Features

- **Blur**: Apply a blur effect to an image.
- **Brighten**: Adjust the brightness of an image.
- **Crop**: Crop an image to a specified rectangle.
- **Rotate**: Rotate an image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
- **Invert**: Invert the colors of an image.
- **Grayscale**: Convert an image to grayscale.
- **Generate**: Create a solid color image.
- **Fractal**: Generate a fractal image.

## Usage

Run the program with the following commands:

```bash
cargo run --release blur INFILE OUTFILE BLUR_AMOUNT
cargo run --release brighten INFILE OUTFILE BRIGHTNESS
cargo run --release crop INFILE OUTFILE X Y WIDTH HEIGHT
cargo run --release rotate INFILE OUTFILE DEGREES
cargo run --release invert INFILE OUTFILE
cargo run --release grayscale INFILE OUTFILE
cargo run --release generate OUTFILE WIDTH HEIGHT RED GREEN BLUE
cargo run --release fractal OUTFILE
```
